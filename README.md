## About The Project

This project was developed to provide a modern, safe, and user-friendly interface for calculating estimated insulin dosages. It takes into account key factors like weight, carbohydrate intake, and current blood glucose levels to provide an estimate for both mealtime (bolus) and correction doses.

The core focus was to build a tool that not only functions correctly but also incorporates critical safety features, robust input validation, and a medically sound logic for its recommendations.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Smart Calculations:** Provides estimates for Total Daily Dose, Basal Dose, and Bolus Dose (for meals and correction).
* **Safety First:** Includes a prominent medical disclaimer and corrected medical logic to provide safer recommendations.
* **Input Validation:** Checks user inputs for logical errors (e.g., negative numbers) and provides clear error messages.
* **Modern & Responsive UI:** A clean, simple, and responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile browsers.
* **Personalized Advice:** Offers color-coded advice and suggested actions based on the user's current blood glucose level.
